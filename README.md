## Data analysis
The files associated with the data analysis can be found under [code_main/scripts/04_hchs_analyses/](https://github.com/anjashahu/causal_matching_paper/tree/main/code_main/scripts/04_hchs_analyses)

## Data
The data files that were used for the simulation study and for the data analysis are not provided within this repository. The data files for the simulation study can be created by running the scripts associated with the simulation study. The HCHS/SOL data files that were used in the data analysis can be obtained by application to dbGaP using the study accession phs000810. Alternatively, the data can also be obtained via a data use agreement with the HCHS/SOL Data Coordinating Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
